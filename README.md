#### Based on my experience learning object-oriented programming languages, here are some tips:

>If the professor teaches the module in a language you are not familiar with (e.g., German), 
focus on the lecture titles. Translate them into English and search for explanations in English. 
This approach will help you grasp the concepts faster since programming keywords are generally in English.

#### To compile a cpp code , execute the following command : 
`g++ main.cpp class1.cpp class2.cpp ... classN.cpp -o OutputFileName`
#### For exampel lets compile the calculator example : 
`g++ main.cpp Calculator.cpp -o calculator`
> the main function is main() and only one class Calculator.cpp and my executable file is calculator
