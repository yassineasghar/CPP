### cpp FRAUAS Bauer-Wersing

#### Based on my experience learning object-oriented programming languages, here are some tips:

>If the professor teaches the module in a language you are not familiar with (e.g., German), 
focus on the lecture titles. Translate them into English and search for explanations in English. 
This approach will help you grasp the concepts faster since programming keywords are generally in English.

#### To compile a cpp code , execute the following command : 
`g++ main.cpp class1.cpp class2.cpp ... classN.cpp -o OutputFileName`
#### For exampel lets compile the calculator example : 
>`g++ main.cpp Calculator.cpp -o calculator`
> the main function is main() and only one class Calculator.cpp and my executable file is calculator
#### Do i need openSuse to learn ? 
>The most of 1 / 2 semster students , think that they must have OpenSuse to learn C/C++ .
>No it's wrong , use windows or MacOs also to learn , don't waste your time booting a new OS.
>You have windows use cmd / powershell / wsl (ubuntu) , just install g++
>You have MacOs use the terminal to compile , install g++ if not available 
#### What IDE (editor) ?
> What ever :) `Kate` is available in MacOs , `vsCode` is also awseome , `Xcode in MacOs` supports also C/C++
> I do not recommand `Sublime Text` 
#### Good Luck
